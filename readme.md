2. Arithmetic Operators 
        let a = 10;
        let b = 5;
        let c = a + b;
        console.log(c);
    *this will equal to 15* 

        let a = 10;
        let b = 5;
        let c = a * b;
        console.log(c);
    *this will equal to 50*


    Assignment Operators
        let x = 6;
    *this assigns 6 to variable x*

        let y = 9;
    *this assigns 9 to variable y*


    Comparison Operators
        let g = 4;
        console.log(g < 7);
    *returns true as g which is 4 is lesser than 7*

        let h = 12;
        console.log(h >= 14);
    *returns false as h is not greater than 14*


    Logical Operators
        let goodGrade = true;
        let goodBehaviour = true;
        let graduateUniversity = goodGrade && goodBehaviour;
        console.log(graduateUniversity)
    *returns true since both conditions are satisfied*

        let goodGrade = true;
        let goodBehaviour = false;
        let graduateUniversity = goodGrade || goodBehaviour;
        console.log(graduateUniversity)
    *returns true since one of the condition has been satisfied*

    Bitwise Operators
    a = 5;
    b = 1;
    c = a & b; 
    c is equal to 1

    a = 5;
    b = 1;
    c = 5 | 1; 
    c is equal to 5
